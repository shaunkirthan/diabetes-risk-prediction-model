# 🧠 Diabetes Risk Prediction Model

A machine learning project to build a predictive model for diabetes classification using the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset. This project is part of **IE7300 - Statistical Learning for Engineering** at Northeastern University.

---

## 📊 Project Overview

This project aims to build a classification model that predicts an individual's diabetes status — **Healthy**, **Pre-Diabetic**, or **Diabetic** — based on 21 health-related features including demographic information, lifestyle factors, and chronic conditions.
